The need for high quality population and housing data is increasingly needed in today's world so that governments and organizations can plan
for the coming challenges of the 21st century. The two main ways of analyzing data are top down and bottom up. Top down is based on the 
analysis of census data from national or state governments. While it is highly useful in stable and developed countries with the resources,
manpower and technology to conduct these surveys, it is very difficult in low income countries, where rapid populaiton growth,
 frequent civil strife and low zoning regulations lead to a lack of reliable information. For example, in the Democratic Republic of
 the Congo, no surveys have been conducted since the 1980's. Bottom up surveys rely on the use of microcensuses and statistical modeling
 to determine where populations are distributed. Researchers take a sample of the population of a small area, and then use this data,
 combined with other relavent factors such as terrain, local infastructure, nightlights and other data to estimate the number of inhabitants
 of an area. While the bottom up apporach is able to more cheaply conduct population estimates of areas, the data collection and analysis
 methods have to be carefully screened to avoid bias. Bottom up methods also tend to prodcue more uncertainty than quality top down surveys,
 but in the case of bottom up surveys, they can quantify the estimated error, which top down surveys can not.
