This plot shows the Governates and Districts of Jordan. I used the Jordanian national colors in the plot, with the colors green, red and
black being associated with the country and Arabs more broadly. I did not have too many problems making this one, other than some early 
problems.

This one was pretty difficult to make. I had trouble naming the variables and when I downloaded the inital raster I kept getting the number of gridcells confused with the number of people. I think the population is roughly half of what it is supposed to be, but that's better than the previous number.

This one was not too hard to make. But it was way harder to combine the plots later.

I do not know why this is not working but for some reason everthing is working except for the colors on my bar graph where not working. I do not know why but I tried to get it done by adding some parentheses to the thing.
