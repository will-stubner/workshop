Contemporary population estimates use a wide variety of sources and techniques to estimate the number of people living in a certain area, combining traditional methods of census with satellite data to improve accuracy. They want to increase the scale of their projects through combining data. A 30 arc second satellite can produce a 1 km by 1 km square. The more spatial datasets incorporated into a population model, the more accurately a typical model can estimate the true number of residents in an area. While previous methods of counting such as surveys did produce somewhat accurate counts of people, they would often undercount in more rural or very densely populated areas, and sometimes overcount in more affluent areas. Using spatial data such as nightlight, road cover, and travel time, as well as geographic factors such as topography and administrative region boundaries as collected by sites such as GADM, researchers can estimate the population of areas with a relatively high degree of accuracy. This is done through combining all of the above mentioned types of data with statistical models that can determine where people would most likely be distributed across an area based on geographic factors. Projects like Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) have been used to estimate the population of city centers, especially in places like Africa where governments may not have the resources needed to conduct accurate censuses due to a lack of resources. The authors use advanced statistical analysis in their estimations of population.
